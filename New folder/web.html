    <h1><b>SMART HOME ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</b> </h1>
    <p1> PROBLEM</p1>
    <p2>
        What is the root cause of the problem?
in order to overcome the problem of inefficient home energy usage often lies in a lack of awareness, education, and effective tools for energy management. Many homeowners are unaware of how their daily choices impact energy consumption and costs. Additionally, the absence of real-time monitoring and control systems makes it difficult for individuals to track and adjust their energy usage in response to changing circumstances, such as occupancy patterns and weather conditions. This lack of awareness and tools leads to a default mode of overconsumption, resulting in higher energy bills and a greater environmental impact we have cameup with the solution of smart home enegy managemement system.</p2>
